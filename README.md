### Hi there 👋

I am a cybersecurity practitioner based in Europe doing DFIR, malware analysis and detection engineering for a number of years. My [*malsub*](https://github.com/diogo-fernan/malsub) and [*ir-rescue*](https://github.com/diogo-fernan/ir-rescue) tools have been used by a number of cybersecurity teams and organizations across the world. If you like my work, you can support me with [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/diogo-fernan).

- 💬 Ask me about cybersecurity;
- 🏔️ Or ask me about mountain biking or snowboarding;
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have lived and worked in five countries.
